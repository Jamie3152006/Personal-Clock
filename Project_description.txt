This is a different way of keeping track of time than the traditional mechanical way because there is no real rhyme or reason, it is based purely off the light of the day, making it an internal clock and more of a mood based way of keeping track of time. I sought to achieve this effect by making the colors change within the sketch to signify the changing light throught the day, from dark to bright. I also made variables on the person change color to show how her mood is being effected, that she changes too with the light, showing a different way of experiencing time. 

I first came up with some ideas, these being, the changing light, seasons passing by, or facial features changing over time. I end up choosing the light one because it is a more day to day basis of keeping track of time instead over an extended period, and I felt that it was more relevant to me as I experience it constantly.

My over all takeaway is that there are numerous ways of keeping track of time other than the conventional, and it really helps to touch upon ech person's unqiue way of doing so and how that alters not only their experience, but the experinece of those around them. For the technical things, I was able to figure out how to make my sketch more designed focus, leaning in on the compostion, while still adding functions to make it interactive and engaging. I am glad I learned how to change color as well as making a circle rotate along a radius, I feel these are certainly going to help in future projects. I also just enjoy the blinking effect that was created, I think it further elevates the humanistic side of this project and makes it seem more alive.
